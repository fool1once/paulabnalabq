    <div class="letter" style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
  hellu Pau… I mean, crushicakes 😳<br><br>

  you probably noticed it already — I’ve had a crush on you these past few days while we’ve been talking. I told you before in a small way, but now I want to say it clearly.<br><br>

  Pau, I like you.<br>
  I like the way you spend time with me — from our 5man (Euclid) to duos. Every time we talk, I feel excited and happy. I get that kilig feeling, especially when you speak. I already told you this before peroo, the way you talk is so cute, and your voice always stays in my head 😍😍<br><br>

  You always make me smile without even trying. Just being with you, even in the simple ways, means a lot to me. I love how you spend time with me, from day till night. I always try to start a conversation, even about random things, just so I can catch up with you — because I just want to spend time with you. I want to learn more about you — how you think, what you feel, what makes you happy. Everything about you makes me want to stay a little longer.<br><br>

  I already noticed you the day we joined the clan. You seemed masungit, pero baby girl naman pala 🥺. I never saw you lumalapag sa GC na tumatawa or nakikipagkulitan — puro barahan 😭, cold pa sakin mag-reply sa GC 😢. I never expected this day would come, pero I'll take this opportunity to say what my heart feels about you.<br><br>

  So yeah… I like you, Pau. I really do. 💖<br><br>

  I'm looking forward to learn more about you, and be the man that you deserve.
