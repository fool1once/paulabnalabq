    <p>hellu Pau‚Ä¶ I mean, crushicakes &lt;3</p>

    <div class="letter">
      you probably noticed it already I‚Äôve had a crush on you these past few days while we‚Äôve been talking. I told you before in a small way, but now I want to say it clearly.

      Pau, I like you.
      I like the way you spend time with me from our 5man (euclid) to duos. every time we talk, I feel excited and happy. I get that kilig feeling, especially when you speak. I already told you this before peroo, the way you talk is so cute, and your voice always stays in my head üòçüòç

      you always make me smile without even trying. just being with you even in the simple ways, means a lot to me. I love how you spend time with me, from day till night. I always try to start a conversation, even about random things, just so I can catch up with you. because I just want to spend time with you. I want to learn more about you, how you think, what you feel, what makes you happy. everything about you makes me want to stay a little longer 

      I alr notice u the day we joined the clan, you seems masungit. pero baby girl naman pala. I never saw you lumalapag sa gc na tumatawa or nakikipag kulitan, puro barahan üò≠, cold pa sakin mag reply sa gc üò¢. I never expect this day would come, pero I'll take this opportunity to say what my heart feel about you

      So yeah‚Ä¶ I like you, Pau. I really do. 

      I'm looking forwards to learn more about u, and be the man that u deserve
